# Booki
Open Classrooms Project 2
Scenario

You’ve got your first internship as a developer for Booki, a small company which offers a holiday planning tool. Booki website helps its users to find accommodation and activities in a town of their choosing. Accommodation can be filtered by things such as budget or atmosphere.

A new design, based on the principles of Material Design, has just been created by Loïc, a UI designer.

 
Mockup of the Booki website
Mockup of the Booki website

 

Before approving a final version of the design the company has decided to create a prototype. You’re in charge of creating this prototype by embedding the mockup in HTML and CSS.

In the morning you receive an email from Sarah, the CTO, providing you with a few final details about the project.

    From: Sarah
    To: You
    Subject: Booki mockups

    Hey,

    We’ve made good progress on the Booki site project. You’ll be dealing with the embedding of the design mockups as HTML/CSS mockups. Your work will then be used as the code base for the rest of the development work. So here are the new mockups that were made by Loïc for both the desktop and the mobile version. This folder also contains the images that need to be embedded into the page.

    I’ve worked with Loïc to prepare a summary document in order to make everything clear for you. It outlines our design specifications as well as some of the technical rules you will need to abide by.

    That’s all for now!
    Good luck with this project!
    Sarah, CTO @Booki

After receiving all this information, you start with a pen and paper. This will allow you to define the main sections of the page before getting started with the embedding work.
Good luck! 

To help you during the project here is an example of how you could work through the various steps that must be completed. This document provides guidance for each step and for how to use the resources available to you during the project.
Deliverables

    A zip file containing the code for the project, named: P2_surname_code.zip (replacing “surname” with your surname). This zip file should contain:
        An index.html file containing the HTML code for this project
        A “css” folder containing the CSS style file(s) required for this project
        An “images” folder containing the entire range of images used for this project

To make things easier for your project defense you should upload all of the deliverables for the project to the platform, in a folder called: “P2_surname_first_name”.

 
Project Presentation (30 minutes)

During the oral presentation your assessor will play the role of Sarah, your CTO. We advise, although this is not compulsory, that you base your presentation around a slideshow.

    Presentation of the deliverables (15 minutes)
        You present your work to your assessor, explaining the technical choices that you have taken. During this section you will present the code you have produced as well as the visuals for the site

        It is up to you in which order you present the key information for your project but here is an example of how you could split up your presentation: 

            2-3 minutes, reminding your listener of the context of the project (what has been done so far, why and for whom) 

            5 minutes to present the visuals, showing the mobile, tablet and desktop versions

            5 minutes to present the code for the project. Don’t hesitate to show the most complex parts that you had to create

            2-3 minutes to give a summary of the project, looking back 

    Discussion (10 minutes) 
        Your assessor, still playing the role of Sarah, will ask you questions about your HTML and CSS code. They may also ask you questions about the validity of your code according to W3C validator
        To prepare for your project defense here are a few example questions:
            What is the semantic web?
            Why is it important to have your code approved by validators?
            What is specificity in CSS?
            How did you analyse and split up the mockup?
            What is CSS cascade behaviour?
            Why is it important to separate HTML and CSS?

    Debrief (5 minutes)
        At the end of the project defense the assessor will stop playing the role of Sarah in order to allow you to debrief. During this part the assessor will go over your presentation and your work as a whole.

 

Your presentation should last 15 minutes (+/- 5 minutes). Given that respecting the agreed timeframes for a presentation is an important part of working life, presentations that last less than 10 minutes or more than 20 minutes may be refused.
